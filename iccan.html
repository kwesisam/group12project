He played a crucial role in shaping ICANN's policies and strategies, particularly with regard to the development of the internet in Africa and other developing regions. Quaynor was a strong advocate for greater participation and representation of developing countries in ICANN's decision-making processes, and he helped to establish programs and initiatives aimed at increasing the involvement of these countries in ICANN's work.</p>
		<p>In addition to his board membership, Quaynor has also served on several ICANN advisory committees, including the Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) and the At-Large Advisory Committee (ALAC). He has also been involved in various ICANN working groups and initiatives focused on issues such as DNS security and the expansion of the domain name system.</p>
		<p>Through his work with ICANN, Quaynor has helped to promote greater transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness in the management of the global internet infrastructure.
