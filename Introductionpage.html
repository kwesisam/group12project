                        Nii Narku Quaynor, the “African father of the Internet,” navigated academic, industry, and      government spheres to conquer first doubt and later intense resistance to his pioneering efforts to connect a continent.<br><br>
                        One of the first computer science PhDs in sub-Saharan Africa, Quaynor was instrumental in the development of Africa’s Internet infrastructure, establishing the first Internet connections, founding key organizations, and working with governments and agencies to promote information communications technology. He was the first African board member at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and established the computer science department at Cape Coast University in Ghana, where he still holds a professorship. In 2012, Quaynor was inducted into the Internets
